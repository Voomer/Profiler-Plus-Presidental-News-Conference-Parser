PresidentParser is a program that aids in the marking-up a speech act to be run through Social Science Automation's Profiler Plus program (http://www.socialscience.net/tech/ProfilerPlus.aspx). Despite the name, which grew out of the original use of the program, PresidentParser is able to parse any type of file that has a consistent pattern. The program ignores the parts of the speech that has not been uttered by the person of interest in response to a question. This means that the initial opening of a conference is ignored, questions are ignored, comments in brackets or parenthesis are ignored, and question headers are ignored. As mentioned in Step 6, the program is highly accurate, but does occasionally miss a part of the conference that should be ignored. The program becomes less stable when used on highly complex files that include many speakers, or many things included in the record dictionary. This makes it necessary to review each speech act after it has been run through the program to make sure Parser caught everything. All output files are saved as .pro file for use in Profiler Plus. The program was written by McKendon Lafleur of Louisiana State University, with a small amount of help from John Beieler, also of Louisiana State University.

The Parser program takes four arguments in its call: 1) the input file 2) the output file 3) the record dictionary, which includes the statements that signal the text of interest, and 4) the ignore dictionary, which includes the statements that signal the text that should be, as the name implies, ignored. 

Included in the same download as this README are five other files. The first two are input and output folders. The input folder contains one speech-act by a U.S. President to be used as a test-case. Next are the two dictionaries. These dictionaries include the common indicators of the record or ignore parts of a speech for U.S. President press conferences. The folder also includes a plain-text version of the commands formatted for both Windows and Mac OS X/Linux, which allows for easy replace/copy/paste into the terminal or command prompt. The final file is the parser itself, named parser.jar. The steps below assume that all of these files remain in the folder PresidentParser, which is placed on a desktop. 

Mac OS X and Linux:

1) Place the unzipped PresidentParser file onto your desktop. 

2) Place the files to be marked-up into the input folder. This folder includes one speech-act for a test. 

3) Open your terminal application. This will be under your Applications folder, in the Utilities folder. 

4) The command to type in the terminal is as follows: java -jar parser.jar "input" "output" "record dictionary" "ignore dictionary"

In the command you should replace the "input" with the path to the input folder you have created. Likewise, replace the "output" with the path to the output folder, so the correct command should look something like this (assuming you placed the PresidentParser file onto your desktop):

java -jar /Users/username/Desktop/PresidentParser/parser.jar "/Users/username/Desktop/PresidentParser/input" "/Users/username/Desktop/PresidentParser/output" "/Users/username/Desktop/PresidentParser/Record.txt" "/Users/username/Desktop/PresidentParser/Ignore.txt"

Note: If you place the parser or files in a folder other than the one included with this download, you will need to fill in the path to it. If this is the case you will need to type something such as /Users/username/Desktop/parser.jar if the program in on your desktop, or /Users/username/Documents/parser.jar if the program is in your Documents folder. 

The program can also be run on a single file with the same command structure as for running a batch of files:

java -jar parser.jar "inputfile" "outputfile" "record dictionary" "ignore dictionary"

5) The program is highly accurate, but does occasionally miss some parts. It is necessary to look over a file after it has been run through the parser to ensure that the program has correctly parsed the file.

Windows:

The steps are the same as for Mac OS X and Linux, except the commands must be entered into the command prompt, found under the Accessories folder in the Start menu. The other exception is that users may need to setup Java to be called from the command prompt. Please follow the guide at http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml to do this. The command, when formatted for Windows, appears as such: 

java -jar C:\Users\username\Desktop\PresidentParser\parser.jar "C:\Users\username\Desktop\PresidentParser\input" "C:\Users\username\Desktop\PresidentParser\output" "C:\Users\username\Desktop\PresidentParser\record1.txt" "C:\Users\username\Desktop\PresidentParser\Ignore1.txt"

As with the Mac instructions, replace the "\username\" portion with your actual username as seen in the command prompt.
